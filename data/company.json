        "name" : "Fíli and Kíli",
        "description": "Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly Bombur, they appear more frequently as 'individual' characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.",
